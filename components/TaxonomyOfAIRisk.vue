                            The high-level taxonomy provides a simple way to cluster risks into one of 27
                            categories, based on the entity, intentionality and timing specified. The categories
                            were developed by repeatedly testing, and improving, a well-known high-level taxonomy
                            (Yampolskiy, 2016).

                            The high-level taxonomy makes it possible to use our database to, for instance, identify
                            all mentions of risks which are presented as occurring pre-deployment or
                            post-deployment, intentionally or unintentionally, and caused by AI or by humans, or any

                            It also provides a way to break ambiguous risks (e.g., biased AI) into parts (e.g., the
                            risk that AI is trained on biased data pre-deployment, or that we deploy a biased AI).
                            Here is the current version of the taxonomy.

                            The mid-level taxonomy provides a more focused breakdown of risk. The categories are
                            being developed by coding all risks against the categories within a well known taxonomy
                            (Weidinger, 2022) then adding new categories from other taxonomies to capture the risks
                            missed.

                            The mid-level taxonomy makes it possible to use our database to, for instance, identify

                            sub-categories, and the sources from which they originate.

                            It therefore provides a way to understand different versions of such risks, for
                            instance, to determine if they are presented as occurring pre-deployment or
                            post-deployment, intentionally or unintentionally, or caused by AI or by humans, or any
